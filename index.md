## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

Welcome! I am currently an Associate Professor in [Division of Environmental Science & Technology](http://www.est.kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp/e/index.html) at [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en) (KYU), Japan.
Prior to that, I served as an Assistant Professor at [International Research Institute of Disaster Science (IRIDeS)](https://irides.tohoku.ac.jp/eng/), [Tohoku University](http://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/).
I earned my Ph.D. degree in Architectural Engineering from [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/), along with a B.S. and M.S. in Civil Engineering from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm) and a B.A. in Economics from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), China.

## Research Interest

My research interests include new techniques in modelling and identification of dynamic systems and data-driven computing methods for structures, soil and fluids, with the goal of contributing to disaster prevention and mitigation.
These research topics straddle computational mechanics and engineering science, combined with knowledge of Bayesian Inference, Artificial Intelligence, as well as Smart Sensing technologies.
I also have expertise in Structural Health Monitoring of large-scale bridges and high-rise buildings.

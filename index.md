## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

Welcome! I am currently an Associate Professor in [Division of Environmental Science & Technology](http://www.est.kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp/e/index.html) of [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en) (KYU), Japan.
Prior to that, I was an Assistant Professor in [International Research Institute of Disaster Science (IRIDeS)](https://irides.tohoku.ac.jp/eng/) of [Tohoku University](http://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/), with [Prof. Kohju Ikago](https://sites.google.com/site/ikagolab/profile).
I obtained my Ph.D. degree in the [Dept. of Architecture and Architectural Engineering](https://www.ar.t.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en?set_language=en), [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/), supervised by [Prof. Izuru Takewaki](http://takewaki-lab.archi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/takewaki_tsuji_lab/home.php?lang=ENG), B.S., M.S. in Civil Engineering from the [Dept. of Civil Engineering](https://www.civil.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm) (THU), and B.A. in Economics at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), China.

## Research Interest

My research interests include new techniques in modelling and identification of dynamic systems and data-driven computing methods for structures, soil and fluids, with the goal of contributing to disaster prevention and mitigation.
These research topics straddle computational mechanics and engineering science, combined with knowledge of Bayesian Inference, Artificial Intelligence, as well as Smart Sensing technologies.
I also have expertise in Structural Health Monitoring of large-scale bridges and high-rise buildings.

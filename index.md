## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

Welcome! I am currently a final year Ph.D. student at [Takewaki Lab.](http://takewaki-lab.archi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/takewaki_tsuji_lab/home.php?lang=ENG) in the [Dept. of Architecture and Architectural Engineering](https://www.ar.t.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en), [Kyoto University (KYU)](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/), Japan. I have obtained my BS (2009) and MSc (2012) in Civil Engineering, with honors, from the [Dept. of Civil Engineering](http://www.civil.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/ce/index.html) at [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html) (THU), China.

## Research Interest

My research interests include advanced signal processing and vision-based techniques to structural dynamics, finite element model updating, structural damage identification and their applications, with an emphasis on structural safety against natural and man-made hazards. I also have expertise in Structural Health Monitoring of large-scale bridges.

## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

Welcome! I am currently an Assistant Professor in [International Research Institute of Disaster Science (IRIDeS)](https://irides.tohoku.ac.jp/eng/) of [Tohoku University](http://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/), working with Prof. [Kohju IKAGO](https://sites.google.com/site/ikagolab/).
Prior to that, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in the [Dept. of Architecture and Architectural Engineering](https://www.ar.t.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en?set_language=en), [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/) (KYU), supervised by Prof. [Izuru TAKEWAKI](http://takewaki-lab.archi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/takewaki_tsuji_lab/home.php?lang=ENG).
I have obtained my BS (2009) and MSc (2012) in Civil Engineering, with honors, from the [Dept. of Civil Engineering](http://www.civil.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/ce/index.html) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm) (THU), China.

## Research Interest

My research interests include new techniques in modelling and control of dynamic structural systems, smart sensors with an emphasis on computer vision-based approach, data-driven computing method, as well as advanced seismic protection. I also have expertise in Structural Health Monitoring of large-scale bridges and high-rise buildings.

## Before Contacting Me (for perspective students)

### Basic Expectations for Daily Work in the Laboratory
* Continuous unapproved absences from the lab or meetings may be seen as a lack of academic commitment and could result in withdrawal from the school in serious cases.
* Weekly one-on-one meetings are required and held in person unless in-person attendance is not possible.
* Social messaging apps like WeChat, LINE, and WhatsApp are not used.
* Communication is limited to English or Japanese.
* Availability of positions for PhD students, postdocs, and visiting students depends on laboratory capacity.

### Doctoral Programs
* Competitive PhD applicants typically have substantial research experience before applying. The focus is on the quality, originality, and potential impact of the research, rather than the number of publications.
* At least one recommendation letter from your current supervisor is required.
* A background in deep learning or statistics is highly recommended.

### Postdoctoral Positions
* Successful candidates typically have three or more impactful publications in a specific research area, demonstrating a clear and cohesive thesis across multiple works.
* At least two recommendation letters are required, including one from the candidate’s current supervisor or host.
* Applicants will be invited to give a research talk (in person or online) and engage with lab members before a decision is made.
* Candidates must have obtained their PhD within the past two years.

### Visiting Students
* The length of the stay is up to negotiation, although the student is expected to be dedicated fully to completing a research project for publication as the first author.
* The student’s current research topic should closely align with the focus of our research team.
* Visiting students are expected to meet the same daily requirements as other laboratory members.

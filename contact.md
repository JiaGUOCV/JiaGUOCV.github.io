## Before Contacting Me (for perspective students)

### Basic Expectations for daily work in the Laboratory
1. Unapproved absences from the lab or meetings may be seen as a lack of academic commitment and could result in withdrawal from the school in serious cases.
2. Weekly one-on-one meetings are required and held in person unless in-person attendance is not possible.
3. Social messaging apps like WeChat, LINE, and WhatsApp are not used.
4. Communication is limited to English or Japanese.
5. Availability of positions for PhD students, postdocs, and visiting students depends on laboratory capacity.

#### Doctoral Programs
1. Competitive PhD applicants typically have substantial research experience before applying. The focus is on the quality, originality, and potential impact of the research, rather than the number of publications.
2. At least one recommendation letter from your current supervisor is required.
3. A background in deep learning or statistics is highly recommended.

### Postdoctoral Positions
1. Successful candidates typically have three or more impactful publications in a specific research area, demonstrating a clear and cohesive thesis across multiple works.
2. At least two recommendation letters are required, including one from the candidate’s current supervisor or host.
3. Applicants will be invited to give a research talk (in person or online) and engage with lab members before a decision is made.
4. Candidates must have obtained their PhD within the past two years.

### Visiting Students
1. The duration of the stay is flexible, but the student must be dedicated to completing a research project with the intention of publishing as the first author.
2. The student’s current research topic should closely align with the focus of our research team.
3. Visiting students are expected to meet the same daily requirements as other laboratory members.
